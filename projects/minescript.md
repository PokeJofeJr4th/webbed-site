Minescript, one of many similar projects of the same name, is a programming language that compiles to a minecraft datapack. I wanted my version to feel like rust. Development has been slowed by API changes to recent Minecraft versions, so minescript is best used with versions of Minecraft with datapack version 16 (minecraft 1.20.1).
